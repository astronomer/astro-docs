_Coming soon..._

In the meantime:

- If you're looking to upgrade to Astronomer Enterprise [v0.16 (latest)](astronomer.io/docs/enterprise/latest/resources/release-notes) from an earlier minor version, submit a request to [our Support Portal](support.astronomer.io).
- If you're already on Astronomer v0.16 and need to upgrade to a patch release, refer to raw instructions [here](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-docs/blob/main/enterprise/v0.16/06_manage-astronomer/05_upgrade-astronomer.md). You're free to perform that upgrade without our hands-on help.

We're working on a more robust and reliable upgrade process for our next Astronomer Enterprise "Long-term Support" quarterly release scheduled for Fall 2020.

Onwards and upwards!
