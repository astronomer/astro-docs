## Astronomer Support Portal

Astronomer provides Support Services through its [online Support Portal](https://support.astronomer.io) which enables submission of support requests. Any necessary telephone support discussions will be scheduled at a time mutually agreed by the parties and for durations and at a frequency that is commercially reasonable for Astronomer.

## Submitting a Support Request

Customer may submit Support Requests 24×7 through the Support Portal. Astronomer’s response will be governed by which SLA support option you have purchased:

* Gold — Astronomer support operates only within 6am-6pm PST on your Support Requests
* Platinum — Astronomer operates 24×7 on your Support Requests

## Priority Levels

Please consider the severity or priority level before submitting a Support Request, in accordance with the following definitions, and Astronomer will take corresponding actions:

| Priority | Definition | Response Time | Astronomer Responsibility |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| P1 | Critical production issue that severely impacts your business operations, and no workaround exists. Data corrupted or lost and must restore from backup.<br />P1 issues require the customer to have dedicated resources available to work on the issue on an ongoing basis with us. | Platinum: Within 60 minutes<br />Gold: Within 4 hours | Astronomer will: (i) assign specialist to the Issue; (ii) provide ongoing communication every two hours on the status of an Update or Issue resolution; and (iii) simultaneously begin work to provide a temporary workaround or fix. |
| P2 | Service is operational but highly degraded performance to the point of major impact on usage, or important features are unavailable with no acceptable workaround; however, operations can continue in a restricted fashion. | Platinum: Within 2 hours<br />Gold: Within 4 hours | Astronomer will: (i) assign specialist to correct the Issue; (ii) provide ongoing communication on the status of an Update or Issue resolution; and (iii) simultaneously begin work to provide a temporary workaround or fix. |
| P3 | There is a partial, non-critical loss of use of the service with a medium-to-low impact on your business, but your business continues to function. Short-term workaround is available, but not scalable. | Platinum: Within 4 hours<br />Gold: Within 1 business day | Astronomer will use resources available during local Business Hours until the Issue is resolved or a workaround is in place. |
| P4 |  Inquiry regarding a routine technical issue; information requested on application capabilities, navigation, installation or configuration; bug affecting a small number of users. Acceptable workaround available. | Platinum: Within 1 business day<br />Gold: Within 2 business days | Astronomer will triage the request, provide clarification where possible, and may include a resolution in a future Maintenance Release. |

All times reported here are estimates and should not be considered as guarantees on Support.

## Updates and Maintenance Releases

Updates may address security fixes, critical patches, general maintenance functionality, and documentation and shall be made available at Astronomer’s discretion. Astronomer is under no obligation to develop any future functionality or enhancements. Astronomer will make Maintenance Releases available to Customer if, as and when Astronomer makes any such Maintenance Release generally available to its customers.

If an Issue has been corrected in a Maintenance Release for Customer’s installed version, Customer must install and implement the applicable Maintenance Release. An Update or Workaround may be provided in the form of a temporary fix, procedure or routine, to be used until a Maintenance Release containing an applicable Update is available.

## Responses

A “Response” is an initial reply to a reported Issue. The Target Initial Response Times shall be measured by the elapsed time between Astronomer’s receipt of a reported Issue and the time Astronomer begins to address such Issue, including by providing a verbal or written confirmation to Customer of such receipt. All customer issues will be addressed by Support based on the priority of the issue and the availability of information required to identify the root cause and resolve the reported problem.

Astronomer does not guarantee resolution times, and a resolution may consist of a fix, workaround, service availability or other solution Astronomer deems reasonable. Astronomer will use reasonable efforts to meet the target response times stated in the table above.

Customer understands and agrees that full resolution of an Issue is not guaranteed and may not occur.

## Customer Responsibilities

Astronomer’s obligation to provide Support Services is conditioned upon Customer satisfying the following responsibilities:

* Customer has made reasonable efforts to resolve the Issue before reporting the Issue to Astronomer, including having the Issue reviewed by the Customer Representative;
* Customer has provided Astronomer with sufficient information, including any reproducible test cases requested by Astronomer;
* Customer has installed all Maintenance Releases;
* Customer has procured, installed and properly maintained all equipment, telephone lines, communication interfaces and other hardware necessary to operate the Supported Software; and
* Customer has designated personnel resources to provide necessary diagnostic information until an Update or Maintenance Release is made available.

## Exclusions

Astronomer is not obligated to provide Support Services to Customer if:

* The Supported Software has been changed or modified (except if under the direct supervision of Astronomer) or damaged;
* The Issue is caused by Customer’s negligence, hardware malfunction, the configuration of the platform or datacenter, network latency or causes beyond the reasonable control of Astronomer;
* The Issue is caused by third party software not licensed through Astronomer;
* Customer has not installed and implemented all available Maintenance Release(s) for the Supported Software; or
* Customer has not paid the Subscription fees when due.

## Escalation

If Customer does not receive Astronomer’s Response within the applicable Target Initial Response Time, Customer may escalate the Issue per the following escalation process:

| Escalation Level | Resolution Owner | Escalation Trigger | Escalation Path |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| 1 | Astronomer Manager, Customer Operations | Response is not received within the Target Initial Response Time | Customer to email support-manager@astronomer.io or by calling +1 (831) 777-2768 |
| 2 | Astronomer Director, Support & Services | Response is not received within twice the Target Initial Response Time | Customer to email support-escalation@astronomer.io |

## Upgrade/Downgrade of Severity Level

If, during the Support Request process, the issue either warrants assignment of a higher severity level than currently assigned or no longer warrants the severity level currently assigned based on its current impact on the production operation of the SaaS offering, then the severity level will be upgraded or downgraded accordingly to the severity level that most appropriately reflects its current impact.
