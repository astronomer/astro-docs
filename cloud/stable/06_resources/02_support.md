Our mission at Astronomer is to help organizations adopt [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).

Since our inception, we've garnered a group of Airflow aficionados and experts who are dedicated to doing what they can to see that your team succeeds.

## Overview

In an effort to democratize all-things Airflow, our team has curated 2 public resources available to all Airflow users:

1. [Astronomer Forum](https://forum.astronomer.io)
2. [Airflow Guides](/guides/)

If you're an Astronomer customer looking for private support, there are 3 ways to get in touch with Astronomer's Support Team:

1. File a request on [Astronomer's Support Portal](https://support.astronomer.io/hc/en-us)
2. Email [support@astronomer.io](mailto:support@astronomer.io)
3. Leave a voicemail on +1 (831) 777-2768

## Astronomer's Support Portal

On Astronomer's Support Portal, you can do two things:

1. Submit a Request (Ticket)
2. Check your Existing Requests

### Create an Account

To submit a request to Astronomer Support, first create an account on our [Support Portal](support.astronomer.io).

If you're working with a team, make sure to create an account with your work email or a domain that the rest of your team shares. This will allow you to have visibility into support tickets across your team.

> **Note:** If your team uses more than one email domain (e.g. @astronomer.io), reach out to us so we can manually add it to your organization.

### Submit a Support Request

When you submit a ticket to Astronomer's Support Portal, keep the following best practices in mind.

**1. Always Indicate Priority**

In order for our team to serve yours most effectively, it's critical that we understand the impact of all reported issues. Generally speaking, here are the guidelines we operate under:

- **P1:** Mission-Critical
- **P2:** Major functionality impacted
- **P3:** Partial/Non-Critical Loss
- **P4:** General Inquiry

**2. Be As Descriptive As Possible**

The more you can tell us about the issue you're facing, the more quickly we can jump in. Consider including the following:

- What project/deployment does this question/issue apply to?
- What did you already try?
- Have you made any recent changes to your Airflow deployment, code, or image?

**3. Attach logs or code snippets if available**

If you've already taken note of any task-level Airflow logs or Astronomer platform logs, don't hesitate to send them as a part of your original ticket.

The more context you can give, the better we can help you.

#### Track Existing Support Requests

Once you've submitted a support request to our team, track our response via our Support Portal.

1. See and comment on requests from your team
2. Check the status of your requests
3. Get responses from us via email

> **Note:** To add a teammate to an existing ticket, cc them in a followup message within the email thread automatically generated when the ticket was created.
