Astronomer Core is a distribution of Apache Airflow ready for enterprise scale. It is completely feature-parallel to the open source project, but with each release, the Astronomer team puts the distribution through a series of rigorous security scans, end-to-end manual QA, and proprietary automated unit and system tests. It is currently used by hundreds of Airflow users in production.
