## What is Astronomer Core?

Astronomer Core is an industry-scale extension of Apache Airflow's production Docker image. It combines Airflowâ€™s extensibility and community-driven development with industry standards for security, reliability, and scale.

For each new release of the open source Airflow image, we rigorously test and build in new dependencies and features for the Astronomer Core equivalent. The result is an even more secure and scalable Airflow image.  

## What's the difference between Astronomer Core and Apache Airflow?

Astronomer Core's Airflow image includes all of the features of Airflow's image, plus additional dependencies which ensure reliability and scalability. For a full list of differences, refer to the Astronomer product chart [link].
